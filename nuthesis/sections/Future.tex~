\noindent The results of this work have showed that better boron carbide based semiconductors can be achieved. However, more testing on neutron detection is needed to fully characterized these semiconductors. In part, an effort towards this end: a passive lightweight neutron detector, UN-DANSON\footnote{\textbf{U}niveristy of \textbf{N}ebraska \textbf{D}etector for the \textbf{AN}alysis of \textbf{SO}lar \textbf{N}eutrons.}, has been designed and placed on the International Space Station (ISS). \\

\noindent The detector contains two different types of materials commonly used for neutron detection, high quality lithium tetraborate crystals with different isotopic compositions, and the boron carbide-based heterojunctions investigated in this dissertation. Both types of detectors are covered by various thicknesses of Makrolon$^{TM}$ polycarbonate material. Figure \ref{Danson} shows a picture of the entire package. \\

\noindent The Makrolon$^{TM}$ polycarbonate is used to slow down the highly energetic incident neutrons, and samples are placed in different positions inside the box, such that each sample will be behind various thicknesses of the moderator material, therefore, irradiation from different energetic neutrons can be studied. \\

\end{figure}

\noindent In the case of the boron carbide-based heterojunctions, all samples were previously characterized by electrical measurements, I(V) and C(V) curves. Hence, by looking at changes in the transport measurements it will be possible to determine how neutron irradiation affects the electrical properties of the detectors. Since previous data (see Fig. \ref{irradiation}) have shown that several hours of neutron irradiation can modify the I(V) curves, it is expected to see significant changes in the electrical response after being irradiated for several months. \\

\noindent On other hand, this dissertation showed that Au/boron carbide-based semiconductors present an unusual behavior when gold (Au) is deposited on the surface. To help in the understanding of these findings, different metals need to be tested, specially metals with lower work function compared to that of the boron carbide, so the four cases discussed in section \ref{secc:Theory_Contacts} will be covered.\\

\noindent It was shown as well, that concentration of the aromatic compounds affects the band gap of the semiconductors, thus, not only variations on the metal can be interesting to study, but also how the aromatic compound to boron carbide ratios can increase/decrease the Schottky barrier formed at the interface.
