\chapter{Module Production for the Phase 1 CMS Pixel Detector Upgrade}\label{ch:phase1}

As discussed in chapter \ref{ch:lhcandcms} the CMS pixel detector will suffer from radiation damage throughout its lifetime hence the need for periodical updates. The first version of the detector was known as phase 0, in 2017 the pixel detector was replaced during the so-called phase 1 upgrade and phase 2 upgrade is projected to take place in 2025\cite{pixels_plans} when the current detector will be close to the end of its lifetime. From 2013 to 2016 the University of Nebraska, high energy group UNL-HEP collaborated with several U.S. institution to deliver almost 600 modules which then became part of the forward region of the pixel detector, (FPix). This chapter will describe  \cite{pixel_performance}
