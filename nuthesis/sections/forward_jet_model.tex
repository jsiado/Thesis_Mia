\chapter{Forward jet impact plots}\label{app:forward_jet_impact}

The impact of the data/MC disagreement for forward jet $\eta$ is observed to be reduced with higher $\pt$ cuts. With a cut of 25 GeV in the \pt of the forward jet, the forward jet nuisance have the biggest impact in the fit (it is in the first place in Figure~\ref{fig:impact25}); when the \pt cut is increased to 30 GeV and 40 GeV, there is a reduction in the impact of the forward jet \etac nuisance in the fit as shown in Figures ~\ref{fig:impact30} and ~\ref{fig:impact40}.
