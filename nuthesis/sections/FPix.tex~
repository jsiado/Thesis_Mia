\chapter{The CMS forward pixel detector}

Located in the Swiss-French border, the European Council for Nuclear Research (CERN) is the largest scientific organization leading the particle physics research; about 13000 people in a broad range of fields including users, students, scientist, engineers among others, contribute to the data taking and analysis, with the goal of devel the secrets of the nature and reveal the fundamental structure of the universe. CERN is also the home of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the largest circular particle accelerator around the world, where protons (or heavy ions) traveling close to the speed of light are made to collide together. These collisions open a window to investigate how particles (and their constituents if they are composite) interact with each other, providing clues about the laws of the nature.

LHC can run in three modes depending on the particles being accelerated:

\begin{itemize}
\item Proton-Proton collisions (pp) mostly general purpose experiments.
\item Lead-Lead collisions (Pb-Pb) Heavy ion experiments. 
\item Proton-Lead collisions (p-Pb).
\end{itemize}

There are several acceletaing stages before the injection to the LHC ring. In the pp mode, after removing the electrons from Hydrogen atoms in a bottle, protons are acceletaed in the LINAC2 to 50MeV and then injected into the proton synchrotron booster (BOOSTER) to reach 1.4 GeV in energy. The next boost is provided at the proton synchrotron(PS) up to 26 GeV, followed by the injection to the super proton synchrotron (SPS) where protons are accelerated to 450 GeV. Finally, protons are injected in the LHC where they are acceletared to the target energy of 6.5 TeV. In the Pb-Pb mode, the Lead ions are first accelerated in the LINAC3 and then passed as long pulses to the Low energy ion ring (LIER) to be converted into short and dense bunches, each containing $7\times10^7$ lead ions. LEIR accelerate the bunches from 4.2 MeV to 72 MeV. The ions are then passed to the PS to follow the rest of acceleration process up to 2.8TeV/n en the LHC ring. Figure \ref{cern} show an overview of the CERN accelerating complex.
